This contains the test images for `tc_texture_load` and `tc_texture_codec`.

Directory structure:
    source/     Source files
                (these are used as inputs for the reference compressor)
    compressed/ Compressed files
                (these are used as inputs for tc_texture_*)
    reference/  Reference, decompressed files
                (these are generated by the reference decompressor, and used as comparison inputs for tc_texture_*)
The general idea is that compressed/$NAME should decompress to reference/$NAME.

All the compressed & reference files follow the same pattern: $NAME.$METHOD.dds
    $METHOD:
        S3TC:
            - bc1: BC1 (DXT1)
            - bc2: BC2 (DXT2/DXT3)
            - bc3: BC3 (DXT4/DXT5)
            - *-srgb: sRGB variants of the above
        RGTC:
            - bc4-*: BC4 (R)
            - bc5-*: BC5 (RG)
            - *-u: unsigned (UNORM)
            - *-s: signed (SNORM)
        BPTC:
            - bc6h-s: BC6H, signed half-float
            - bc6h-u: BC6H, unsigned half-float
            - bc7: BC7
            - bc7-srgb: BC7 in sRGB mode

Example for `nebula`:
- Source file: source/nebula.exr
- Compressed to: compressed/nebula.bc6h-s.dds and compressed/nebula.bc6h-u.dds
- Then decompressed back (*from* compressed): reference/nebula.bc6h-s.dds reference/nebula.bc6h-u.dds
